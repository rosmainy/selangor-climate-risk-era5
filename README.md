## 🏢 Corporate R&D Initiative
This repository represents the core **Technical Proof-of-Concept (POC)** developed by **Falak Tech**, a Malaysian-based Deep-Tech Startup.

We are pioneering a **Context-Aware Disaster Monitoring System** that fuses satellite data, astronomical calculations, and traditional **Falak Turath** to identify flood risks with greater localized accuracy.

## 🚧 Product Roadmap
Our development pipeline is structured to ensure robust commercial deployment. We are currently finalizing Phase 1 validation:

| Phase | Module | Status | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase 1** | **Data Intelligence** | 🟡 **VALIDATION STAGE** | ERA5 analysis active. Currently integrating official **PHN** (National Hydrographic Centre) tidal data for final calibration & performing multi-variable stress testing (Model vs. Ground Truth). |
| **Phase 2** | **Hardware Innovation** | 🔄 **ONGOING** | Prototyping proprietary **RF-Based IoT Sensors** for real-time ground truth verification (Patent Pending). |
| **Phase 3** | **Commercial Deployment** | 🔜 **PLANNED** | Enterprise Dashboard API for B2B/B2G clients & Mobile App integration. |

## 🎯 Our Unique Value Proposition (UVP)
While global giants (like *Windy.com* or *OpenWeather*) provide world-class real-time visualizations, they rely on "Macro-Scale" models that often lack **localized historical context** and **cultural ecological markers**.

**[Falak Tech]** aims to bridge this data gap by focusing on two specific niches overlooked by standard weather apps:

### 1. 📍 Hyper-Local Granularity & Historical Intelligence
*   **Global Limit:** Major apps average out weather data over large districts and lack "Institutional Memory" of past disasters.
*   **Our Edge:** We focus on **Micro-Climate Zones** with a multi-hazard approach:
    *   **Beyond Floods:** Predicting severe storm trajectories and rainfall intensity anomalies at the street level.
    *   **Historical Hotspot Mapping:** We map years of disaster records to specific coordinates.
    *   **"History-Aware" Alerts:** Our system triggers a **"BEWARE" Alarm** when current real-time weather patterns match the exact conditions of past disasters in that specific hotspot.

### 2. 📜 Falak Turath Innovation (Algorithmized Heritage)
*   **Global Limit:** Western models do not account for centuries of local climatological records found in Malay & Islamic manuscripts.
*   **Our Edge:** We are the first to **digitize and algorithmize** traditional environmental indicators from:
    *   *Kitāb al-Anwā'* (Ibn Qutaybah) & *Piama Kedah* (Malay Agro-Calendar).
    *   Using these historical cycles to validate modern "Outlier Events" (e.g., Extreme rain during specific lunar phases).

## 📊 Executive Summary
This system establishes a climatic baseline for Selangor by processing hourly data points from 2020 to 2025 using **ERA5-Land Reanalysis**.

**Key Insight:** The data reveals a distinct upward trend in rainfall intensity in **2024**. By overlaying this with our Astronomical and Turath modules, we aim to predict **Compound Risk Events** (Rain + Tide + Storm Surge).

## 📡 Proprietary Hardware: Next-Gen IoT Sensing (Confidential)

While data analysis provides historical context, **[Falak Tech]** is developing a proprietary hardware solution for **Real-Time Ground Truth**.

*(Note: Due to pending Intellectual Property (IP) registration and patent filing, the specific engineering architecture of this module is currently classified.)*

### 🌧️ The Concept: Non-Mechanical RF Sensing
Unlike traditional "Tipping Bucket" gauges that are prone to debris blockage and mechanical failure, our prototype utilizes **Advanced RF Signal Attenuation Technology**.

*   **The Innovation:** We move away from mechanical measurement to **Atmospheric Density Sensing**.
*   **The Capabilities:**
    *   **Instant Detection:** Detects rainfall intensity the moment it starts (t=0), unlike physical gauges that need water to accumulate first.
    *   **Zero-Maintenance:** No moving parts, suitable for deployment in remote or harsh urban environments.
*   **The Value:** Provides a critical **15-30 minute lead time** for flash flood warnings before water levels rise on the ground.
